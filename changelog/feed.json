            "content_html": "<p>Welcome to the new Pixly site. It&#x27;s been a while since the site last got a refresher, and since it started to return 403s at some point, I decided to migrate it to this new domain and upgrade a few things!</p><p>...</p><p>To start, <strong>every GIF has been fixed</strong>. At some point in the last 4 years GfyCat changed their API and the embedded GIFs here in the guide all went missing, but now they&#x27;re back!</p><p>Some of the documentation has also been updated, and <strong>wording has been improved</strong>. My English skills are now much better than when I first wrote all these :)</p><p>The documentation is now a modern web app. It has always been fully server-side rendered, but it would refresh the whole page when you navigated somewhere else. While that was still very fast (every render was obviously cached), it still wasn&#x27;t as instantaneous as it is now, as the browser fetches the content dynamically as you navigated. For the nerdies out there, the new site is developed with <a href=\"https://docusaurus.io\">docusaurus</a>, and you see all the source on <a href=\"https://github.com/tavomaciel/pixly-docs\">GitHub</a></p><p>Speaking of source, that also means that everyone can contribute to the guides, or help fix existing problems! You can find all the Markdown files for every guide page on <a href=\"https://github.com/tavomaciel/pixly-docs/tree/main/docs\">GitHub</a> and submit your pull requests with changes!</p><p>This new site also include the <a href=\"/changelog\">changelog</a> section (<em>which you are reading right now!</em>) and it will include information about any new updates to the app or site in the future. Changelogs are going to be a little bit more formal from the next post, so I also plan to include a DevLog in this site at some point, so I can talk about how things are being developed, and what to expect.</p><p>Stay tuned for the Pixly updates coming in 2022! There&#x27;s a lot already implemented for 1.8, and if you want a spoiler, check the <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/271M0NG9/pixly-todo\">roadmap</a>!</p>",

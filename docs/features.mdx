### Mini view with customizable level of zoom for quick preview.

### Dropbox and Google Drive integration;

### Interface designed to 4.7"+ device screens, minimalist and cohesive.

### Designed with touch-screens in mind.

Some interfaces work great when you have a keyboard to help you use shortcuts, but then, when working on a touchscreen, the good experience goes down the drain. That's why Pixly was made for touch-screens, You have easy access to important features with gestures that feel natural. For example, even though the "Color picker" tool is there, you can pretty much pick colors just by dragging from the color selector to the artboard. **gif here**

### Contextual tools for easy access

Switching between two tools everytime? Eraser then brush, then eraser, then brush, then eraser... You think doing that without a keyboard will be hard? Think again!

### Undo and Redo that WORKS.

Every change goes through the memento system, and you can undo everything. It works seamlessly for batch operations, effects, transforms, selection and much more.

### Since you're on a phone or on a tablet, why not socialize?

You can share your work, check the latest @PixelDailies themes and @DailySilhouette from twitter, and even share as gifs!

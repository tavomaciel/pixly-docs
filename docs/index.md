### Pixly is an Android pixel art and animations editor.

And these are the wiki pages to guide you through it.

Pixly is not complex and you can start pixeling right away, but since touchscreens are a whole new medium to editing art, you might want to read some of the guide to help you get the best experience from your art sessions.

#### How should this guide be read?

You may use this guide to [check if something is already implemented](./features.mdx), and if it isn't, [check the roadmap](https://trello.com/b/271M0NG9/pixly-todo) and vote on the card if it's there. You can [e-mail me](mailto:gus@tavomaciel.com) if you want to propose something that is not in the roadmap yet.

If you just wanna learn more, don't be afraid to explore the menu (left on desktop, hamburguer icon on top for mobile), most pages will expand and reveal new ones inside them.

If you don't know where to start, try reading [The Basics](./guides/basics.md) and going on from there.

If you want to know how pixly started, why it was developed, who I am, and who made this possible, read the [About page](./about.mdx).

### Wait, wasn't this guide available at another domain?

This guide was originally written for `pixly.meltinglogic.com`.

A few articles have been rewritten and it is now available on my personal domain `pixly.tavomaciel.com`. The source code is open at [GitHub](https://github.com/tavomaciel/pixly-docs) if you want to contribute!

### Thanks
Thanks for stopping by!

Pixly is a Pixel art editor made in [LibGDX], its focus is to help game developers make their pixel art on Android devices.

Pixly development began on **January 10th of 2014** as a toy project, but soon enough it got way better than many of the other pixel art editors that were available for Android at that time. So I decided to rise its priority over other projects of mine.

After around two and a half years of development, Pixly was released on the PlayStore **July 12th 2016**.

The app is currently being maintained on my free time, and you can check the [Roadmap] to check what are the upcoming features.

### Backbone

Pixly is wrote in Java/Kotlin and [libgdx], and all it uses for graphics is OpenGL ES.

### Interface

The whole interface was made from scratch. Windows, dialogs, color choosers, buttons, gestures... No library was used, not even Android's, not even LibGDX's Stage2D.

At first, all buttons, windows and dialogs were only rects, and the first icons (which were made on GIMP), were all 16x16, and very ugly:

<GfyCat id="FragrantRingedKakarikis"/>

Some time around 2014 I decided to give a facelift on the app and spent some time redesigning the UI. I picked up a palette (the [Arne palette][arne], you can find it on the app), and re-made all the icons, made a patch-9 for the buttons and the windows. Moved some stuff around, and the result is pretty much what you see today.

And believe it or not, all the icons were made inside Pixly itself. Most of them were done while I was on bus/subway commuting to uni. No joke.

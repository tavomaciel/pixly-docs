There are two ways to delete a frame. The easiest one is to hit the *minus* button on the left side. That will remove the current selected frame and all its layers from the animation.

If you want delete any frame that is not the current selected one, you can just swipe that frame up, and that frame (and all it's layers) will be removed from the animation.

You may be used to hit `CTRL+D` all the time, but you won't have a hard time switching over. That's because the **"Unselect"** will be right in front of you most of the time. You just hit it, and all your selection disappears.

You also have the option to unselect only pieces of stuff, by using the [marquee remove tool][marquee del].

<GfyCat id="WindingMildAddax"/>

For now, [selection brush] and [magic wand] can't unselect, but soon they'll the option to do so.

[marquee del]: ../toolbar/tools/marquee/deselect.md
[selection brush]: ../toolbar/tools/marquee/brush.md
[magic wand]: ../toolbar/tools/marquee/wand.md

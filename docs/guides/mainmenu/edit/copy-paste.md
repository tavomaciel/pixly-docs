Pixly has its own clipboard system for copy and paste (independent from the Android clipboard).

This means that you can copy and paste areas of images inside Pixly, even though (currently) Android doesn't allow you to. Here's how it goes:

+ [Select] something;
+ On the Edit menu, tap **Copy Selected**;
+ Choose a frame and layer you want to paste to;
+ On the Edit menu, tap **Paste Selected**;
+ Move, scale and rotate as desired;
+ Enjoy

:::info
All pixels that are the same color as the [secondary color] will be interpreted as background, and won't be copied. If you have problems making copy-paste work, try resetting your secondary color **before copying** something.

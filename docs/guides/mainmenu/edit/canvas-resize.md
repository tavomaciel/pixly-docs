Whether you run out of space on your artboard, or want it to be smaller to better fit your art, resizing the canvas is an easy and intuitive operation on Pixly.

You don't need to guess a good width and height in number and type in. Resizing the canvas in Pixly is as easy as dragging the borders of the artboard until it is the size you want it to be.

Still want to see the width and height in numbers? No problem! They're still there ;)

You can use Free transform to do what the [basic transforms] can't, or even do it but with different settings.

<GfyCat id="InformalMaleGodwit"/>

:::note
Things to keep in mind:

+ If no area is [selected], the whole canvas will be selected.
+ All pixels the same color as the [secondary color] will be treated as background and completely ignored from the operation.
+ Given the above, try setting your secondary color to your background color before transforming it.

In view, you can find options to customize what you want to see during your painting sessions.

+ [Setup Reference Image][references]
+ Change Background color

   Will get you to a [Color selector], upon which you can change the color behind your artboard.

+ [Setup Mirrors][mirrors]
+ [Configure grids][grids]
+ [Tile Image][tile]
+ Toggle Mini view

   Show or hide the [mini view].

+ Toggle Artboard Controls

   Show or hide the artboard controls, which are the pan and zoom button. You can totally live without them, but they are useful for big screens.

+ Toggle Rulers

   Will show or hide the rulers on top and right of the screen.

+ Toggle Touch coordinates

   Will show or hide the touch coordinates, a red thingy that show the coordinates of your finger while you paint, which some people find helpful.

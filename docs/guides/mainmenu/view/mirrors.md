import GfyCat from '/src/components/GfyCat';

### Setup
On the mirror setup screen, hit *"Add Mirror"* to create a new mirror. Use one finger to drag the mirror around, and use two fingers to rotate that mirror.

<GfyCat id="MetallicNiftyBoar"/>

Up to 4 mirrors can be on the artboard at the same time.

### Working with mirrors

Having a mirror on the screen mean everything you do to one side of it, will be reflected to the other side. Check out:

This can be used to do all tricks with symmetry.

:::note
As this feature is experimental, it may fail sometimes. Although I found it pretty solid during tests with horizontal and vertical mirrors, it's still a little buggy with mirrors on diagonals.

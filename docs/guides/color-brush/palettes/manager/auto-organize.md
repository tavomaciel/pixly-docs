title: How auto-organizing works
---
If you want to organize your colors automatically, without switching them one by one, then auto organize is what you're looking for.

As soon as you tap it, you'll see a list of combinations you can choose.

One example is **R**, **G**, **B**. This means the colors will be organized from the one with the greatest **R**ed to the one with the smallest **R**ed. In case of a tie, from greatest **G**reen to smallest **G**reen, and again, in case of a tie, from greates **B**lue to smallest **B**lue.

:::tip
**Hu**, **S**, **L** is usually the most useful.

Try them out, you might find one that pleases you!

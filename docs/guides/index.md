This section has guides for the [features](../features.mdx) that are already present in pixly, where you can learn more from these.

### [The Basics](./basics.md)

Here's where everyone should start. This section covers what you need to know to start using pixly, from artboard to basic brush.

### [Animation](./animation/index.md)

Dig through these to learn more about the timeline and how to manage frames. Making animations is cool!

### [Color and brush](./color-brush/index.md)

Primary and secondary colors, selecting colors, palettes... All you should know!

### [Layers](./layers/index.md)

Build complex and/or modular scenes with layers. Might worth reading to know a shortcut or two.

### [Selection](./selection/index.md)

How to make the most common operations with selections.

### [Mini view](./miniview/index.md)

Learn about it and the big preview mode.

### [Toolbar](./toolbar/index.md)

This is a quite important section. Learn how the toolbar works, what goes to the Quick access, and most important, **read about all the [tools](toolbar/tools/index.md)**.

### [History](./history.md)

Undo, Redo, and what might go in there.

### [Main Menu](./mainmenu/index.md)

The lack of a keyboard in touchscreen devices makes this section very important. Most of what you accomplish will be found here, instead of in keyboard shortcuts, so give it a go.

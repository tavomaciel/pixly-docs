The same as the brush, though it cycles the colors while you paint.

This is more of a tool to play around and test colors.

### Settings

+ Change color by

  You can choose if the cycling will be done for each *pixel*, by the speed of the *motion* or even by *time*.

+ Cycle through

  What colors do you want the tool to cycle through? The colors of the **rainbow**? Back and forth between the **[primary and secondary colors][psc]**? What about through all the colors of **a given [palette]**, in the order they are found in that palette? Try them out!

+ Selected palette

  In case you are cycling through a given palette, here you can choose which palette it is. Tap "Pick" to choose it!

+ Speed

  How fast should the colors change by iteration?

+ Hue, Saturation and Brightness

  The hue the brush will start at on the next stroke, and the saturation and brightness the colors will have.

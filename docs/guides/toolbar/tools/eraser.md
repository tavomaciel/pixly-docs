It's just like the brush, but only for the [secondary color]

In layers that have no [transparency], like the bottom layer of non-transparent projects, the eraser will paint the [secondary color]. In transparent layers the eraser will simply delete the pixels it passes through.

Keep in mind that [opacity] is also valid for the eraser.

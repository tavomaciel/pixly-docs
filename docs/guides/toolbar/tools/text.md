![Icon](./icons/text.png)

These tools help you placing text in the screen.

:::note
This feature was recently added, so it's a little rough in the edges:

Currently the only 3 fonts included are the ones that make up the whole pixly UI. Later it might support custom fonts.

You can't scale nor rotate text right now. You might use the [free transform] operation to do it.
:::

### Place Text
![Icon place](./icons/placetext.png)

The text that is currently written will be stamped right under your finger.


### Write Text
![Icon write](./icons/writetext.png)

Change the text that is written to something else.


### Settings

+ Font

  Small, Normal and Narrow, are the current options for now.
